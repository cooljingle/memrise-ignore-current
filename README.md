Lets you ignore the last word you did via a keyboard shortcut or clicking a link.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-ignore-previous/raw/master/Memrise_Ignore_Previous.user.js

After installing you can edit the shortcut key in the script (default corresponds to \` ), it has to be pressed outside of an input to activate.
Additionally these is a link 'Ignore Previous Word' on the left side.
